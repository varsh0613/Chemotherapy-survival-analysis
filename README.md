Chemotherapy Survival Analysis Across Five Cancer Types

This independent project focused on analyzing chemotherapy survival outcomes across five major cancers: breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. Although initiated as a team project, I independently handled data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, modeling, and dashboard creation, as my team failed to contribute meaningfully.

My primary focus was on breast cancer, but I also ensured the overall structure and analysis quality across the other cancer types.

Key Contributions:
Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Managed all preprocessing tasks including null value handling, encoding categorical variables, and deriving new clinical insights from raw data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to investigate relationships between patient demographics, treatment types, and survival outcomes.

Survival & Predictive Modeling:

Utilized Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression for survival probability estimation.

Developed a predictive classification model (e.g., Random Forest) to estimate survival likelihood with an 88% relevance score, based on key patient and treatment factors.

Cross-Cancer Comparison: Conducted comparative analysis across all five cancer types to explore differential survival trends and influencing variables.

Power BI Dashboards: Created an interactive Patient Demographics Dashboard to support visual analysis and clinical storytelling.

This project reflects my capability to manage end-to-end analytics — from raw data to insights and visualization — and demonstrates initiative, technical skill, and accountability in a high-stakes, research-driven setting.
